I dunno what to write so nyehehe
Import palette : import an already present palette of brushes, it doesn't reflect in the json, its just the brushes you will have available without manually adding them. 
Map ID: can have space, what's shown in game as name
 Special ID (for mapgen): this is the entire structures I'd basically 
 om_terrain (Group ID): this is, imo, the one for per floor. 
 Selector : 
 Drag around button/finger, copies area. 
 Can rotate said area. 
 Hold in an area and it shows paste preview. Pastes after a second. 
 As of now, also has a nested creation tool. 
 Inspector :
 Useful for adding items/monsters to certain coordinates.
